# Snake
Classic Snake Video Game created while bored at work using a tutorial.
Sounds weren't part of the original tutorial and where added by my own want.
Main loop was taken from a royalty free site from where it was converted on Audacity from a MP3 to a WAV, the "NOM" sound was recorded by me using Audacity.
Press "Q" at anytime to end the game

"Snake" - Action Adventure Game created originally back in 1976, this is a low budget, low end remake of the classic game with missing multiplayer/obstacles.

Anyone is free to customize this and change it as they but if you do so please leave this repository as it is and reupload as your own REPO.

Adjustments will be made to hopefully create randomly generated walls sometime in the near future.
